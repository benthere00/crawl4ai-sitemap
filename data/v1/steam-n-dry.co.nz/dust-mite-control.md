The heat generated can penetrate various surfaces and fabrics, potentially killing dust mites and their allergens. Dust mites are microscopic arachnids that thrive in warm and humid environments. They are a common cause of allergies and asthma and can be found in bedding, upholstery, and carpets. These tiny creatures feed on dead skin cells and can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. When combating dust mites, it’s crucial to ensure that the steam is hot enough to kill them. Most steam cleaning devices produce heat at temperatures between 212°F (100°C) and 302°F (150°C). At these temperatures, dust mites and their eggs are to be destroyed. High heat The high heat can directly impact dust mites by denaturing their proteins and disrupting their bodily functions. This can lead to their death and significantly reduce their population in treated areas. It can also help remove allergens, dust, and debris from surfaces, reducing the dust mite allergens. To effectively kill dust mites, focus on treating areas where dust mites are prevalent, such as mattresses, pillows, upholstered furniture, and carpets. Thoroughly steam these surfaces, ensuring deep penetration into the fabric to reach any hidden house dust mites or eggs. If you have concerns about dust mite allergies or infestations, it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or an expert in pest control.
