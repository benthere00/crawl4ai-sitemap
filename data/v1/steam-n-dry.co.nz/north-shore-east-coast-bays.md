We strictly adhere to the National Carpet Cleaners Association Standards . Our truck-mounted steam cleaning process for carpets typically takes approximately 2-4 hours. Furthermore, apart from our carpet cleaning services, we also offer flood repairs, stain removal, sanitisation, and upholstery cleaning. Moreover, maintaining the cleanliness of your carpets is crucial, whether in your home or office. It is not solely about their visual appeal but also about safeguarding yourself from allergies and other potential illnesses.

Additionally, there is always the risk of spills on these carpets. Rest assured. Our carpet cleaning team can handle that expertly in carpet cleaning. Auckland Steam ‘n’ Dry mainly uses hot water extraction, also called steam cleaning. We recommend at least once a year, if not twice, cleaning your carpets or upholstery at your home or office, depending on the type of carpets.
