Back to Top Most Common Carpet Cleaning Methods In Auckland To ensure your carpet warranty remains valid, it’s essential to use the hot steam water extraction method for regular carpet cleaning. This method involves several stages to deliver the best results—first, thoroughly pre-vacuuming the carpet. Next, the cleaning solution is agitated into the carpet pile, followed by hot water extraction. Additionally, deodorising and hot steam rinsing are included in the process. This comprehensive approach effortlessly keeps various surfaces in your home spotless and fresh. As approved by the leading carpet manufacturers . Commonly referred to as steam carpet cleaning, hot water extraction uses high pressure and heated water to agitate carpet fibres and effectively dissolve embedded dirt. There are two types of steam cleaning: Truck-mounted steam carpet cleaners, which are the most effective carpet cleaning method, and portable steam cleaning, which is suitable for apartments and high-rise buildings. Truck-Mounted Carpet Cleaning Method You will find a few professional carpet cleaners who can deliver the power of truck-mounted hot water extraction carpet cleaning and upholstery. Auckland  Steam ‘n’ Dry’s truck mounts set us apart from other professional cleaning companies. You can benefit from this superior truck-mounted carpet cleaning in many ways: Your home space is free of clutter during the cleaning. The only equipment coming into your home or workplace is a carpet cleaning wand and hoses — the truck-mounted hot steam extraction unit stays outside on the truck. Dirty, unhealthy air and humidity are exhausting outside. Thus, it includes allergens, bacteria, dust mites, and other pests. You don’t supply your electrical power or hot water — Our truck-mounted unit does. According to Auckland Council regulations , all effluent goes to a waste holding tank, then is disposed of off-site. Powerful Vacuum System Auckland Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleaning Services truck mounts employ a powerful vacuum system for maximum vacuum extraction of soil, allergens, detergent, germs, viruses, and moisture.

We have researched 17 scientists and proven them to kill 99.9%  of coronaviruses, including SARS elimination methods as additional options. Shampoo Cleaning Method An older carpet cleaning method was prevalent when hot steam cleaning gained popularity. Shampooing carpets, although effective for heavily soiled ones, has its drawbacks. It tends to leave behind a wet foam residue, making the drying process time-consuming and leaving the carpet feeling sticky, as there’s no rinsing involved after shampooing. Moreover, this method can lead to rapid re-soiling of the rugs. In this method, a cleaning solution is used with a circular brush. The rotary action creates a foam that captures dirt and grime. However, this process also results in a residue that can attract soil, making it less favourable compared to better carpet cleaning methods available in Auckland. Bonnet Chem-Dry Carpet Cleaning Method The Bonnet Chem-Dry Carpet Cleaning Method typically employs chemicals and heat to break down oily build-up within the carpet fibres. It utilises absorbent pads that rotate at high speed beneath a rotary machine, often called a bonnet buffer. These pads pick up soil and oils from the carpet, akin to using a towel to clean hair. However, it’s important to note that this method primarily delivers surface-level cleaning results. It involves cleaning the upper portion of the carpet fibres with a heavy machine equipped with a spinning pad that applies a cleaning solution to absorb surface dirt. This approach has drawbacks, including the risk of leaving behind residue and potentially damaging loop pile or wool carpets. For a comprehensive carpet cleaning service, it’s essential to address spot and stain treatment. This process should also include neutralising, rinsing, sanitising, and deodorising to ensure a thorough cleaning. The product commonly used in this method is foam. The machine generates foam and utilises brushes to apply the foam to the carpet, potentially offering more effective cleaning. However, it’s worth noting that this method may be convenient for use during office hours. Absorbent Compound (Encapsulation) Cleaning Foam encapsulation uses synthetic detergents that crystallise into a powder as they dry. When applied, the foam traps loose dirt particles in the carpet fibres, forming a dry, powdery residue. Once the foam has dried, the encapsulated dirt can be easily removed by vacuuming or brushing. Low-moisture encapsulation was developed and endorsed by all major world carpeting manufacturers.
