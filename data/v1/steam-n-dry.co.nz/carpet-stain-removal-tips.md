Here are some carpet stain removal tips to help you tackle common stains effectively: 1. Act quickly: The faster you respond to a stain, the better your chances of removing it quickly. 2. Blot, don’t rub: When dealing with liquid stains, use a clean cloth or paper towel to blot the stain. Rubbing can push the stain deeper into the carpet fibres and spread it. 3. Test cleaning solution: Before applying any cleaning solution to the stain, test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the carpet to ensure it doesn’t cause discolouration or damage. 4. White vinegar for general stains: A mixture of equal parts of white vinegar and water can be good in removing various stains like coffee, tea, juice, and pet stains. Blot the stain with the vinegar solution and repeat until the stain is gone. 5. Baking soda for odour and grease: Baking soda is crucial for odours and tackling grease stains. Sprinkle baking soda over the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then vacuum it. 6. Hydrogen peroxide for tough stains: Hydrogen peroxide can be used for stubborn stains like blood or ink. Apply a small amount directly to the colour, let it sit for a few minutes, and then blot with a clean cloth. 7. Professional cleaning: For deep or persistent stains, hiring professional carpet cleaners like Auckland Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleaning Services is a good idea. They have the expertise and equipment to remove tough stains effectively.
