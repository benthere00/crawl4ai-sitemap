Truck-Mounted vs. Portable Steam Cleaners According to many carpet manufacturers and carpet fibre producers, hot water extraction, also known as steam cleaning, is the best carpet cleaning service method. Our proprietary truck-mounted equipment employs 84°C hot steam to kill and remove germs, viruses, dust, allergens, and dirt. 7x better clean result. Thus, it is the only carpet cleaning method classified as “deep cleaning.” Most manufacturers recommend hot water extraction steam cleaning because it can clean the carpets more thoroughly. All the others are doing only a light interim clean because they cannot remove soil deep in a pile. Other rug cleaning methods also leave large amounts of the cleaning agent in the carpet after cleaning. Due to the aggressive scrubbing action, these dry methods can damage fibres, especially wool. Not All Carpet Cleaners Can Clean Alike. Should I pay extra for a better carpet cleaning service result? We have been asked this question so many times over the years. Many consumers need to learn the difference. I need to know. They see a carpet cleaning machine that shoots down water and a vacuum hose sucking it out. Each carpet cleaning method has pros and cons, and they have their place in the market. The maintenance brochures published by the world’s largest carpet manufacturer, Shaw Industries , recommend this method because its research indicates that it provides the best capability for cleaning carpets and rugs. Both are acceptable Hot Water Extraction steam cleaning machines, which many carpet manufacturers require yearly to keep warranties valid, but many differences exist. The carpet manufacturers also require that you be an IICRC Certified Firm. Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleaners Auckland The business has been family-owned since 1987.

However, for superior results, we rely on powerful truck-mounted cleaning machines , which use scorching steam to eliminate more dirt, viruses, allergens, bacteria, dust mites, germs, and stubborn stains. Portable Steam Cleaning Auckland Services Electric vacuums run on portable. These electric vacuums generally have enough power to create sufficient suction for about 5 metres of hose. Together with a vacuum booster, you can achieve 7 metres of hose. These have electric pressure pumps that can power up to 500 PSI. Portables built with around 35-litre recovery and solution tanks. Some portable units have an inline water heater that can achieve about 55 °C if heated long enough. As an owner, I started my company in 1987 using portable machines and Chem-Dry carbonated bonnet cleaning systems. I did a satisfactory cleaning, but the cleaning used many cleaning chemicals, which consumed a lot more time, and the carpet took too long to dry. The water on a portable steam cleaner can only be as hot as the water from your faucet, usually about 45°C. However, when it leaves your hot water faucet and is put in the machine, it gets much colder when the cleaning begins. It’s a fact that for every ten °C degrees over 30°C, the cleaning solution’s chemical action doubles. Both machines can clean carpets. However , because the portable cannot achieve high PSI, it cannot clean tiles or hard floor surfaces, because a truck mount can only run up to a hundred metres of hoses. Therefore, the portable is best for cleaning carpets in high-rise buildings or apartments, higher than the 4th storeys or large commercial apartment complexes that cannot reach over a hundred metres of hoses. Portable Steam Cleaners Are Good For High-rise And Large Apartment Buildings Vacuum power is the most critical difference between the two steam cleaning machines. Truck mount units have much more ability than portable steam cleaners . The truck-mounted steam cleaning unit has higher PSI and water pressure, and the vacuum is so powerful that most carpets touch dry in 3-5 hours. Portable steam cleaners d o not have this capability. The “professionalism” issue is because when one uses a mobile, they must drag the machine into the customer’s house, high-rise buildings, or apartments. They generate a lot of noise inside and can sometimes smell. The waste air is often exhausted inside with germs. Most portable steam cleaners require an overnight recommended dry time in houses, high-rise buildings, or apartments. Therefore, it causes underlying dirt and stains to wick and bleed to the carpet’s surface. It could be more convenient and healthier for the consumer. Moreover, powerful vacuum suction means better extraction of spots, soil, grease, dust, moisture, and other contaminants from the carpet. Truck-Mounted Steam Cleaning System Health-wise, the truck-mounted upholstery and carpet cleaning system are preferred because the dirty air, moisture, and humidity are exhausted outside rather than recirculated throughout the house. Two to four-cylinder petrol or diesel engines power truck-mounted machines. The engine powers the more significant suction vacuum and the spray pump. There is enough vacuum power to use a hundred metres of hoses and achieve up to 3000 PSI. These machines use large heaters or heat from the motor to heat the water. They can reach over 145 °C . The cold water source for these truck-mounted carpet cleaner machines is pulled directly from a garden hose. It’s connected to the garden outlet outside of the customer’s house. Inside the van, you can fit a 100-litre recovery tank. Additionally, truck-mounted steam cleaner systems are more powerful than portable units and can do a much better upholstery and carpet cleaning. They can get the carpets to dry more quickly. Thus, it is the first positive fact about using a Truck-Mounted Cleaning System. The water in a Truck Mount is continuously heated to over 145°C (usually between 75-80 °C at the carpet fibre). That’s a lot more hot steam action and a better clean result. The increase in heat is more beneficial to break down the soil, germs, grease, allergens, and other spots for complete removal. Also, we use fewer cleaning solutions, but effective for a healthier environment. Truck-Mounted Steam Cleaning Units Have Hotter Steam, Higher PSI, And Far More Powerful Vacuum = Far Better Clean Results. Water pressure PSI is another big difference between a portable and a truck-mount steam cleaner . The cleaning process needs to be repeated, with pure steam extraction for sufficient upholstery and carpet cleaning results. If not, the remaining chemicals and re-soiling residues will quickly collect soil again, causing your carpet to get dirty faster. A portable steam cleaner is capable of 50-500 PSI. That’s a little, and if the carpet steam cleaning technician does not take the time to rinse thoroughly, you are stuck with the chemical on your carpet. A carpet is ideally flushed at 400-600 PSI, which a truck-mount steam cleaner can achieve consistently. (Truck Mount steam cleaner can go as high as 3000 PSI. However, this is for hard surfaces. A higher PSI helps to agitate the fibres, loosening spots, oils, and soil for more effective removal. My conclusion on the steam cleaner issue is that portable units do have a place in the market. They are suitable for areas where a truck-mounted steam cleaner cannot access. I understand that portables are an affordable option for startup upholstery and carpet cleaning businesses in Auckland. However, they should avoid tackling heavily soiled, standalone houses—especially those where the air is contaminated with bacteria and germs. While it’s possible to upgrade a portable steam cleaner for better performance, truck-mounted units are still more powerful and consistently deliver superior results. Mobile units can be a stepping stone for new Auckland carpet and upholstery cleaning businesses, generating enough cash flow to eventually invest in one of the world’s best truck-mounted steam cleaning machines. Truck-mounted steam cleaners provide a superior clean for customers. They deliver hotter steam, higher water pressure (PSI), and significantly stronger vacuum suction . As a result, they offer far better overall carpet cleaning outcomes compared to portable machines. Uses And Capabilities Because portable units cost around $4,000, they are a better option for a startup company. However, truck-mounted steam cleaners provide better heat and suction, leading to superior results. These machines can cost up to $55,000, not including the van they are mounted in. Portable units are ideal for locations where larger machines can’t reach, such as high-rise buildings and apartments. Truck-mounted steam cleaners, however, require significantly more maintenance. Since they run on petrol or diesel, they need regular oil changes and burn about 3 litres of fuel per hour. Additionally, there are ongoing costs for van insurance and fuel. With more moving parts, truck-mounted systems require frequent repairs and tune-ups. Despite the higher maintenance demands, some customers perceive them as more professional.
