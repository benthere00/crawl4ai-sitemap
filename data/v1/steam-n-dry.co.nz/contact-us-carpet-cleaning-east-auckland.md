Certainly, the Hot Steam Water Extraction (HWE) method is known as “hot steam cleaning.” Of course, with more advanced truck-mounted cleaning systems than regular steam treatments, the pressurised hot steam water extraction method uses high agitation and hot steam water to increase the soiling reaction rate. Here’s how it happens: High-performance truck-mounted units “inject” hot steam deep into the fibres of your textile upholstery or carpets. Simultaneously, a powerful vacuum suction removes up to 95% of moisture, germs, viruses, dust mites, allergens, and pathogens. Therefore, Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleaning East Auckland Services uses premium truck-mounted cleaners and non-toxic citrus pre-spray. Undoubtedly, this means you get a fresh and cleaner carpet that’s not full of re-soiling residues and chemicals that can harm your children, family, and pets. Above all, professional Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleaning East Auckland services offer an effective solution for deep cleaning your carpets and removing dirt, stains, and allergens. Therefore, by investing in this service, you can enjoy clean, fresh carpets that enhance the overall aesthetics of your home while promoting a healthier indoor environment. Thus, remember to choose a reputable service provider and follow the recommended carpet maintenance tips to keep your carpets looking their best. Hence, regular carpet cleaning is essential.
