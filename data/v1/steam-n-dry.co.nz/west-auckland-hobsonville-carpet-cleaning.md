Let’s explore the differences between a portable carpet cleaning unit and heavy-duty truck-mounted equipment. Portable units have limitations, restricting the depth of cleaning they can achieve. On the other hand, truck-mounted equipment utilises powerful, industrial-grade machines that run on gas and can generate water temperatures close to boiling point, high pressures, and a robust vacuum system. Indeed, these features enable them to handle various tasks effectively, including flood repairs, stain removal, sanitisation, and upholstery cleaning. Steam ‘n’ Dry Carpet Cleanings in West Auckland offers these comprehensive services. One of their highly effective methods is the hot steam extraction technique, which involves injecting a hot detergent solution under pressure for exceptional cleaning results. Specifically, pre-treating the heavily soiled and stained carpet areas enhances this method’s effectiveness.
