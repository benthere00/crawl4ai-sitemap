Pest Control Maintenance Checking For Indoor Pests Check every entry parallel to the outside, like doors, electrical entries, pipelines, window frames, and wiring. Are any repairs required? Seek out insect, rodent entry and activity indicators, for example, waste droppings and gnawing marks. First of all, employ rodent traps before using rodent bait. Use insecticides cautiously if needed. Therefore, following label instructions and checking outdoors is crucial. Ensure the inside of your home is clean and free of clutter and food crumbs. Pest Prevention Checklist Check every container, such as pet food and watering bowls, birdbaths, for leftover food and stagnant water. If you feed more than your pet needs, you are attracting predators to dine in your yard. If you leave standing water, you are luring mosquitoes to breed. Check if the window and door screens fit securely and the caulking joints are in good order. Also, weather stripping, as well as sweeps, aren’t allowing light and pests through. Check the efficiency of the mowing program you have. Seek the presence of thatch. If the grass is too high between mowings, you might require adding a mowing day. Roofing and tall grass permit insects and rodents to move unnoticed in your yard, offering weeds time to mature and replant. Check for cracks, holes, and electrical issues. Besides, plumbing line openings and seal off any you find with caulk. Look for outside places on your property for bushes and weeds. Check for standing water and puddles. If you find any, ensure to create and carry out plans to supply drainage. Find any debris, rubble, and garbage. Then, take away anything found. Check around for landscape plants, bushes, tree limbs, and vines reaching your home. Trim them down if they are. They give a roadway for insects to enter your home. Thoroughly vacuum your house and, if possible, leave pets outside to best control fleas. Thus, has your carpet been cleaned regularly, preferably by a truck mount carpet cleaner that can produce over 70 °C steam, killing fleas ? If you haven’t, consider doing a pest flea control treatment.
